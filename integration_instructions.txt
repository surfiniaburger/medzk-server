1. **Add the integration script:** Add the following line before the closing </body> tag in your `map.html` file:

   ```html
   <script src="integration_script.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Ensure API keys are set:** Make sure that your `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is correctly set in your HTML file.

3. **Test the integration:** Open `map.html` in your browser. You should now see a "Use My Location" button. Click it to search for nearby hospitals using your current location.  The existing Places API search should still function as before.
